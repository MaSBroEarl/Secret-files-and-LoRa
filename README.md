# About project: 
This project is dedicated to the development of a machine learning model for predicting financial crises based on the analysis of news headlines and financial reports. By using natural language processing (NLP) methods and the modern architecture of LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation), we aim to adapt pre-trained language models for working with financial data, enabling forecasts without the need for complete model retraining.
